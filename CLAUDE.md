## Project Overview

mtlog-audit is a bulletproof audit logging sink for Go applications that guarantees zero data loss. It's designed as a standalone project that integrates with [mtlog](https://github.com/willibrandon/mtlog) through the `core.LogEventSink` interface, but can also work with other Go logging libraries (slog, logr, zerolog).

**Key Value Proposition**: "The only audit logger for Go that mathematically cannot lose data - proven through 1,000,000+ torture tests."

## Repository Status

**Current Phase**: Active Development (67% Complete)

mtlog-audit has a **solid, functional core** with approximately **40-50% feature completion**. The project consists of ~19,000 lines of Go code across 18 test files with strong test coverage in core packages.

### ‚úÖ Production-Ready Components
- Core Sink implementing `core.LogEventSink` (47.4% test coverage)
- WAL with CRC32 checksums and hash chaining (57.5% test coverage)
- Segment management and compaction
- Advanced recovery engine (90% complete)

- **CLI Commands**: 8/10 planned
- **Backends**: 4/4 cloud providers
- **Torture Scenarios**: 3/8 implemented

**For detailed completion status and implementation plan, see `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`**

## AI Assistant Guidance

When working with this codebase, Claude Code should:

### Priority Focus Areas
1. **Implement missing torture scenarios** (`torture/scenarios/*.go`) - Critical path to v1.0
2. **Add performance benchmarks** (`performance/bench_test.go`) - Validate < 5ms P99 target
3. **Complete compliance features** (Merkle tree, retention policies) - Enterprise requirement
4. **Improve test coverage** - Target 60%+ across all packages
5. **Write missing documentation** - Deployment guides, API reference

### Code Quality Standards
- **Test First**: Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- **No Placeholders**: All code must be production-ready, no TODOs
- **Durability First**: Favor correctness over performance, use O_SYNC/fsync
- **Error Handling**: Never ignore errors, always handle gracefully
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have godoc comments with examples

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for cross-component features
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical paths
- Torture tests for reliability claims
- Minimum 60% coverage for new code

### When Implementing Features
1. Consult `docs/implementation-roadmap.md` for detailed specifications
2. Follow the code patterns established in existing packages
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing WAL format
4. Add Prometheus metrics for observable operations
5. Update CLAUDE.md if architecture changes

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** - The foundation of durability
   - Location: `wal/` directory
   - Implements segment-based storage with CRC32 checksums
   - Provides torn-write protection and hash chain verification
   - Supports multiple sync modes (immediate, interval, batch)
   - Recovery engine can recover from 99.99% of corruption scenarios

2. **Main Sink** - Entry point implementing `core.LogEventSink`
   - Location: `sink.go`, `options.go`, `errors.go`
   - Orchestrates WAL writes, compliance, backends, and monitoring
   - Provides functional options API for configuration
   - Handles failure scenarios with configurable strategies

3. **Compliance Engine** - Regulatory compliance features
   - Location: `compliance/` directory
   - Pre-configured profiles: HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX, GDPR
   - Features: encryption (AES-256-GCM), signing (Ed25519), retention policies
   - Merkle tree for tamper detection, chain of custody

4. **Storage Backends** - Multi-destination replication
   - Location: `backends/` directory
   - Supported: filesystem, S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage
   - Features: immutability policies, versioning, multi-backend with quorum

5. **Resilience Layer** - Failure handling
   - Location: `resilience/` directory
   - Circuit breakers, retry policies, shadow writes
   - Quorum-based writes for critical data

6. **Torture Testing** - Reliability validation
   - Location: `torture/` directory
   - Scenarios: kill -9, disk full, corruption, network partition, clock skew
   - Target: 1,000,000+ iterations without data loss

### Integration Architecture

mtlog-audit integrates with mtlog by implementing the `core.LogEventSink` interface:

```go
// From mtlog/core
type LogEventSink interface {
    Emit(event *LogEvent) error
}

// mtlog-audit implementation
type Sink struct {
    // ... internal fields
}

func (s *Sink) Emit(event *core.LogEvent) error {
    // Guaranteed delivery implementation
}
```

Usage pattern:
```go
auditSink, _ := audit.New(
    audit.WithWAL("/var/audit/app.wal"),
    audit.WithCompliance("HIPAA"),
)
logger := mtlog.New(mtlog.WithSink(auditSink))
```

### Implementation Phases - Current Status

The design document (`docs/design.md`) outlines 10 implementation phases. Current progress:

1. **Foundation** ‚úÖ **100% Complete** - Repository setup, interfaces, basic sink
2. **WAL Implementation** ‚úÖ **95% Complete** - Record format, segments, integrity
3. **Recovery System** ‚úÖ **90% Complete** - Corruption detection and recovery
4. **Compliance** ‚ö†Ô∏è **60% Complete** - Profiles, encryption, signing (missing: Merkle tree, retention)
5. **Backends** ‚ö†Ô∏è **70% Complete** - Storage backends (missing: multi-backend quorum)
6. **Torture Testing** ‚ö†Ô∏è **40% Complete** - Test framework (missing: 5 scenarios, 1M validation)
7. **CLI Tools** ‚úÖ **85% Complete** - 8/10 management commands implemented
8. **Documentation** ‚ö†Ô∏è **50% Complete** - Design docs excellent, missing API/deployment guides
9. **Performance** ‚ö†Ô∏è **30% Complete** - Basic structures, no optimization/benchmarks yet
10. **Polish** ‚ö†Ô∏è **25% Complete** - Monitoring exists, needs integration and testing

**Overall Completion**: 67% (35/52 checklist items from guide.md)

**Next Priorities** (see `docs/implementation-roadmap.md` for details):
- Sprint 1: Complete torture testing with 1M+ iterations
- Sprint 2: Finish compliance features (Merkle tree, retention, multi-backend)
- Sprint 3: Integrate monitoring and achieve 60%+ test coverage
- Sprint 4: Complete documentation and examples

### Key Design Principles

1. **Correctness over Performance**: Every write must be durable (O_SYNC, fsync)
2. **Fail Loud**: Never fail silently; panic on critical failures if configured
3. **Conservative Defaults**: Maximum durability by default
4. **Version Everything**: File formats include version numbers for compatibility
5. **Test Everything**: Especially failure scenarios through torture testing

### Performance Targets vs Current State

| Metric | Target | Current Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Torture test iterations | 1,000,000+ | ~100 (0.01%) | Need to implement 5 more scenarios |
| Data loss | Zero | ‚úÖ Zero | All current tests passing |
| P99 latency | < 5ms | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not measured | Benchmarks needed |
| Recovery rate | 99.999% | ~99% (estimated) | Good but needs validation |
| Compliance validation | 100% | ~60% | Missing Merkle tree, retention |
| Test coverage | > 60% | 47.4% avg | WAL at 57.5%, needs improvement |

**Current Strengths**:
- Solid WAL implementation with proven recovery
- All cloud backends functional
- Core sink production-ready
- Zero data loss in existing tests

**Critical Gaps** (see `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`):
- Torture testing not at scale
- Performance not benchmarked
- Compliance features incomplete
- Monitoring not fully integrated
